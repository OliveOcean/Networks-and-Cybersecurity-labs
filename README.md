# Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs
A repo of all my computer networking and Cybersecurity labs and projects

[Lab 1](https://github.com/OliveOcean/Network-Security-Final-Project/tree/main): NTI's NetSec final project. This project simulated the deployment of a real-world enterprise-grade network: scalable, secure, and resilient — covering everything from addressing and routing to security, monitoring, and VPN connectivity.

[Lab 2](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%202.pkt): Basic University VLAN configuration with trunking using this [guide](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/lab05_vlan.pdf) (Note: In the guide, There's a mistake in step 4.11: the IP address of 172.17.20.22 is already taken, so try any other IP address from 172.17.20.2 to 172.17.20.254 except 172.17.20.22 and 172.17.20.25 because these IP addresses are taken by PC2 and PC5 respectively) (Note 2: PC1 was left configured in VLAN 20 as per the last steps, but it's supposed to be in VLAN 10)

[Lab 3](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%203.pdf): Botium Toys security audit (A small security audit of a fictional company)

[Lab 4](https://github.com/EngMostafaSherif/Networks-and-Cybersecurity-labs/blob/main/Lab%204.pdf): A Google cybersecurity activity where I analyzed and troubleshooted the components of a tcpdump log where the DNS server was not working as intended
